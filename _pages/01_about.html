                        Python Sprints is a non for profit group of like minded programmers who care about making open source projects better.
                        We believe in sharing our skills for free to earn our good karma. If you are devoted to a particular open source project, please let us know, we could make a sprint dedicated to it!
                        Inclusion is in the nature of our group and we want to make sure that no one is underrepresented. All people are welcome.

                            Our group was founded in October 2017. As all things in life the beginnings were humble with only a handful of people collaborating but the word quickly spread and now we have nearly 600 members and counting.

                            We believe in helping each other to bring the knowledge in the group up to the highest possible level. Anyone can ask a question and expect aid in their problems during the session. We have people using all kinds of OSes, editors etc. and we all sometimes struggle but a solution is just ask someone else to have a look.

                            Usually there is a subject advertised well ahead of the time with clear setup instructions so that everyone can come prepared.
                            But you should not worry if setting up is difficult - part of our creed is to help new people get introduced into the world of open source.
                            Help will be provided even if it is just creating a git repository and learning how to contribute. It is all part of growing our group organically and all people are welcome!
                            All the coding aside there is always time for a joyful banter, sharing work and life experiences with pizza and beers to hand.
