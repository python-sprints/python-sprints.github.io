===========================
Pandas documentation sprint
===========================

The pandas documentation sprint is a worldwide event that will take place
the 10th of March of 2018. During the sprint open source hackers will work
on improving the `pandas API documentation
<https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html>`_.

While most of pandas documentation is great, very extensive, and easy to follow,
the API documentation could in many cases be better. Many of the `DataFrame`
or `Series` methods for example, are documented with simply a one liner
summary. In some cases, the documented parameters are not up to date with
the actual method parameters. And while docstrings use the numpy docstring
convention, they could benefit from some pandas specific convention.

There are around 1,000 API pages in pandas, meaning that the effort to fix,
standardize and improve all the API documentation is huge. But the pandas
user base is also huge. And Pythonistas are very active and well organized.
So, we will work together from all around the world to take care of every
single API, in a single day.

This document provides all the necessary information to participate to the
pandas documentation sprint.
