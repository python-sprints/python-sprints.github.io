This sprint part of a series (until the features are complete). That's probably 2 or 3 sprints in total. Every event is independent, and you don't need to attend the first part to attend the second (or the other way round).

• Waiting list: Even if you are added to the waiting list, keep an eye the day of the event. There are many people dropping just hours before the event.

The sprint

To communicate during the sprint (also remotely), you can use this gitter [channel](https://gitter.im/py-sprints/python.org)

Around 7pm, it'll be a short hangouts, [you can join in this link](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/calendar/bnFjZWkxM2NvZDBhZ3FiNWk2Z2s5Y2kxOWdAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ.49ls39sk27behs8rvnrqtdgs02?authuser=0)

The Python community and the Python Software Foundation are using [http://www.python.org](http://www.python.org) as their main website. Besides general information about Python, the Python installation files, the documentation, the job board and links to other resources, the website includes a section to list all the events of the community, [https://www.python.org/events/](https://www.python.org/events/).

The process to update the content of this section is not optimal, and it is taking too much time from the community (event organizers and python.org moderators mainly).

A new workflow has been proposed to automate some parts and make the process much more efficient. Details can be checked in this ticket:

http://www.python.org is built in [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/).
