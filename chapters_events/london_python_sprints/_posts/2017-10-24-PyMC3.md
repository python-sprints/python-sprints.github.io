Probabilistic programming are a family of programming languages where a probabilistic model can be specified, in order to do inference over unknown variables.

A common application is in financial markets, where probabilistic programming can be used to infer expected returns or risk.

The best introduction to Bayesian methods and probabilistic programming I know is this [excellent book](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers).

[PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3) is a Python package for Bayesian statistical modeling and Probabilistic Machine Learning which focuses on advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational fitting algorithms.

In this sprint we'll address [PyMC3 beginner friendly issues](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abeginner_friendly).

If the meetup is full, or you can't attend in person, feel free to join remotely:
