Welcome to the first sprint of Python Sprints Zürich!

In our first meetup, we'll have the opportunity to contribute to [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org), one of the [most popular](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle-survey-2022) open-source libraries for machine learning!

We'll have core developers from scikit-learn leading the sprint. As always, we welcome new contributors. For beginners in open-source, we will have a beginners' table where you can make your first pull request on GitHub.

Please read the details below for more info on how to prepare for the event and what to expect during the evening.

This event has **limited seats** and may have a **waiting list**. If you're confirmed but can't attend, please remember to release your place to someone else. Similarly, please don't show up if you're on the waiting list but haven't been confirmed. Unfortunately, we won't be able to accommodate more people than planned.

- Create the scikit-learn development environment following the [instructions](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html#how-to-contribute) from steps 1 to 6
- (Optional) [Extra videos resources](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html#video-resources) are also available:

- If you can, set up the development environment as shown above. If you experience any problems, we'll help you fix them during the event.
- Check out the videos linked above to get familiar with the process of contributing to scikit-learn.
