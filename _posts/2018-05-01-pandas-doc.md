The 10th of March, around 500 people in 30 different locations worldwide,
contributed together to improve pandas documentation.

While many great contributions were made, pandas has around 1,200 API pages.
So, there is still some work to do.

In this sprint, each pair of participants (or each participant if you prefer
not to pair-program) will be assigned a pandas documentation page to work on.

By the end of the sprint, you should be able to convert a page like this:
- <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.plot.kde.html>

In a page like this:
- <http://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/generated/pandas.DataFrame.plot.kde.html>

Before the sprint, it's recommended to:

- Bring your own laptop
- Set up your environment
- Join the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/py-sprints/pandas-doc-london) of the sprint

In order to create a more inclusive environemnt, we host events specific for underrepresented
groups in our events. This sprint is one of them, and is for **gender minorities** (meaning
women, trans, non-binary... but no men).
