As Pythonistas, we all use [http://www.python.org](www.python.org) at some point: to download Python, for the documentation, the list of events, the jobs board...
But no so many of us contribute to it, and as the website is mainly maintained by volunteers, some times it becomes outdated.

In this sprint we have a mission, update the website, and also make future contributions easier. And to achieve it, we will work in:
- Updating the website to the latest versions, Python 3.7 (already in beta) and Django 2.0
- Improve the website documentation (set up instructions...)
- Make local set up easier (build scripts, make the website sqlite compatible/ready...)

While most of our meetups are beginner frienndly, as we love to mentor people on how to contribute to open source Python projects and to Python itself, in this case we require a decent level of experience in Django.
So we can get as much of this important work done.

In the sprint, we will divide us in 4 groups, and we will work in the next issues:
- Migrate website to Python 3.7: <https://github.com/python/pythondotorg/issues/1267>
- Migrate websute to Django 2.0: <https://github.com/python/pythondotorg/issues/1268>
- Replace ruby gems by Python equivalents: <https://github.com/python/pythondotorg/issues/1269>
- Use sqlite as default backend: <https://github.com/python/pythondotorg/issues/1270> (and improve the set up instructions and eliminate any other barrier found during the set up of a development environament, like failing dependencies when building Pillow)
